                OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit 
                Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast 
                Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, 
                With loss of Eden, till one greater Man 
                Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, 
                Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top 
                Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire 
                That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, 
                In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth 
                Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill 
                Delight thee more, and Siloa's brook that flow'd 
                Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence 
                Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, 
                That with no middle flight intends to soar 
                Above th' Aonian Mount, while it pursues 
                Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. 
                And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer 
                Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure, 
                Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first 
                Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread 
                Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss 
                And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark 
                Illumin, what is low raise and support; 
                That to the highth of this great Argument 
                I may assert Eternal Providence, 
                And justifie the wayes of God to men.
